    <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

      HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper <strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. HTML is the standard markup
      language for creating Web pages. It defines the content and structure of
      the web content. HTML is a formal recommendation by the World Wide Web
      Consortium (<em>W3C</em>) and is generally adhered to by all major web browsers.
      HTML5 is the latest version of the specification.  Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.
